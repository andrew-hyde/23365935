<!-- First: Set your default preferences for chunk options: -->

<!-- If you want a chunk's code to be printed, set echo = TRUE. message = FALSE stops R printing ugly package loading details in your final paper too. I also suggest setting warning = FALSE and checking for warnings in R, else you might find ugly warnings in your paper. -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 5, fig.pos="H", fig.pos = 'H')
# Note: Include = FALSE implies the code is executed, but not printed in your pdf.
# warning and message = FALSE implies ugly messages and warnings are removed from your pdf.
# These should be picked up when you execute the command chunks (code sections below) in your rmd, not printed in your paper!

Question 1.1

See if you can provide some insights using the dataset into how African countriesâ€™ experience differed from other regions.

```{r fig.height= 7}
graph_q1.1_func(df_data = df_q1.1_data,
                title = "Covid Cases and Deaths",
                subtitle = "Plot of Total Cases and Deaths per Continent",
                caption = "",
                xlabel = "Continent",
                ylabel = "Per Million")

```

Question 1.2

Provide some insights into whether countries with specific concentrated groupings (e.g. more
poverty, higher prevalence of smokers, higher general life expectancy and elderly populations) displayed distinct patterns in the severity of their Covid experience.

```{r}
graph_q1.2_func(df_data = df_q1.2_data,
                title = "Covid ",
                subtitle = "Plot of  Continent",
                caption = "",
                xlabel = "Country",
                ylabel = "")


```

Question 1.3

Show how quickly different regions increased their hospitalization facilities, and whether
this led or lagged ICU admissions.

```{r}
graph_q1.3_func(df_data = df_q1.3_data,
                title = "Number of icu_patients_per_million and hospital_beds_per_thousand over time",
                subtitle = "per Continent",
                caption = "",
                xlabel = "Continent",
                ylabel = "")
```
